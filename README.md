Repository specifically for the raw csv files of the GiveSendGo public donation data for the "freedom convoy 2022" campaign and the "Adopt a trucker" campaign. 

If you want to gather donation, comment and public facing "names" for any other GiveSendGo campaigns, see https://github.com/noskillsben/givesendgo_donation_scraper

If you want to see transformed data, see https://observablehq.com/@5e9ee33b437339a5/canadas-freedom-convoy-2022-donation-data

I had not run the scraper in a few days but it looks like they made the donation endpoint internal only so I wont be abel to add more donation data to these files. Sorry


# Update on 2022-02-24
the Freedom convoy is still getting a few donations per day but the adopt a trucker cmapaign seems to have hit a wall with the last donation 3 days ago. I will keep scanning both campaigns daily but will only update the files when new donations come in.
